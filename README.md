PLEASE NOTE: I am not working on this publically right now. I have joined a private team and will not pick this project up until a later date. Hopefully this code is useful to someone.

# redemrp_gameplay
Here are a set of jobs developed for fun in my spare time for the redem roleplay framework. I am giving out the source code for these jobs in the hopes that other servers might find them useful.
