Here are a set of jobs developed for fun in my spare time for the redem roleplay framework. I am giving out the source code for these jobs in the hopes that other servers might find them useful.

These jobs are a work in progress. If you want to see these jobs in action, we have a developmental roleplay server up named "Desperados Roleplay."
